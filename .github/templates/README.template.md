# Mailauth

Mailauth is a Mailbox Manager which enables you too select between your Mailboxes and authenticate with your Mailserver (like [mailcow](https://github.com/mailcow/mailcow-dockerized))

## Getting Started

Get the latest version of the `docker-compose.yaml` file:

```yaml
{ { file.docker-compose.yaml } }
```

### Setup

Mailauth _currently_ works by modifying the `email` claim during Token Exchange and Userinfo,
this means that you **will have to** use a IdP (like [authentik](https://goauthentik.io)).

Create a `.env` file inside of you `docker-compose.yaml` directory and copy the template below

```dotenv
{ { file.examples/config.env } }
```

Now you need to setup a Oauth Authentication Method in your mailserver,
but instead of using your IdP's endpoints you use:

- `/oauth/mail/authorize`
- `/oauth/mail/token`
- `/oauth/mail/userinfo`

And set Redirect URI to the one from your `.env` file.

Next create `init-mongo.js` in your working directory:

```js
{ { file.examples/init-mongo.js } }
```

### Reverse Proxy

When working with Oauth2 and Auth in general it is recommended to be sure to use secure connections,
here you will see a Reverse Proxy implementation with traefik:

```yaml
{ { file.examples/traefik.docker-compose.yaml } }
```

## Usage

When authenticating via mailauth you get redirected to your actual IdP then to `/select`,
where you will be able to select your mailbox, mailauth changes the `email` claim and now you're logged in.
